# Shiny applications for FISH 323 Winter 2022

## Setup
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo contains a bunch of shiny apps used for teaching FISH 323. 

To run locally

1. Fork the repository and clone to your machine

2. Open R and set your working directory of the cloned repository (or just use RStudio projects)

3. This project is set up with [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage package dependencies. Inside R (and with your working directory set correctly) run `renv::restore()`. This will install the correct versions of all the packages needed to replicate our results. Packages are installed in a stand-alone project library for this paper, and will not affect your installed R packages anywhere else.
